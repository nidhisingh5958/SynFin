# System Overview

## What is the Financial AI System?

The Financial AI System is an intelligent backend service that provides comprehensive financial analysis and advice through a unified API. It combines rule-based analysis with AI-powered insights to help users understand their spending patterns and make better financial decisions.

## Key Capabilities

### ðŸ¤– Intelligent Query Routing
- **Master Agent**: Automatically classifies user queries and routes them to appropriate handlers
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Handles expenditure analysis, financial insights, tax advice, investment guidance, and revenue analysis
- **Natural Language Processing**: Users can ask questions in plain English

### ðŸ“Š Expenditure Analysis
- **Automatic Categorization**: Groups expenses by category
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies spending trends and behaviors
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates totals, averages, and breakdowns
- **AI-Generated Summaries**: Natural language explanations of spending patterns

### ðŸ’¡ AI-Powered Insights
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored advice based on user context and spending data
- **Financial Health Scoring**: 1-100 scale assessment of financial wellness
- **Actionable Advice**: Specific steps users can take to improve their finances
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Considers user situation (student, professional, etc.)

### ðŸŽ¯ Specialized Financial Advice
- **Tax Guidance**: Deduction tips, filing advice, tax planning
- **Investment Recommendations**: Portfolio advice, risk assessment, strategy guidance
- **Revenue Analysis**: Income optimization, business financial insights
- **General Financial Planning**: Budgeting, saving, debt management

## How It Works

### 1. Unified Chat Interface
```
User Input â†’ Master Agent â†’ Query Classification â†’ Specialized Handler â†’ AI Response
```

The system accepts natural language queries through a single `/chat` endpoint. Users can:
- Ask questions in plain English
- Provide expense data for analysis
- Get contextual advice based on their situation

### 2. Intelligent Classification
The Master Agent uses Groq's LLM to understand user intent:

```python
"Analyze my spending" â†’ expenditure_analysis
"How can I save money?" â†’ insights_generation  
"What can I deduct on taxes?" â†’ tax_advice
"Should I invest in stocks?" â†’ investment_advice
```

### 3. Specialized Processing
Each query type has dedicated handlers:
- **Expenditure Analyzer**: Processes spending data, calculates patterns
- **Insights Agent**: Generates personalized recommendations using AI
- **Financial Advisors**: Provide domain-specific guidance

### 4. Structured Responses
All responses follow a consistent format:
```json
{
  "response": "Human-readable answer",
  "query_type": "Classification of the query",
  "data": "Optional structured data"
}
```
